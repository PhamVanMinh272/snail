# Motivation?
When you want to know how to upload and download basically,
please look into this project.

In this project I want to practice:
- write cloudFormation file
- connect to S3 using boto3
- CRUD data in S3

Deployed in account phamvanminh272

# Requisite to run project
- Python 3.11
- S3 bucket
- 

# CloudFormation
Problem 1: I don't know how to upload multiple code files for a function.
Temp solution: upload the whole project for a function.


# Connect to S3
Where is S3 bucket?
I created by cloudFormation, then go to aws console to get information
